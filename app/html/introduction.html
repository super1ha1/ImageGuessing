                    In the game, first, you will have time to see 60 randomized pictures. <br />
                    After that, you would need to answer some question about the famous people in the world. <br/><br />
                    Then, the most interesting part is that you would have a chance to answer 10 questions.
                    For each question, there would be a pair of images, one image you have seen in the first session.<br/><br />
                    The other image is very similar is the correct one. Your task is to pick the image you have seen. All the best!<br/><br />
                    Before we begin, please tell us a little bit about yourself.
