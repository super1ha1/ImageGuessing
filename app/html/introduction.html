                    In the game, first, you will have time to see 60 randomized pictures.
                    After that, you would need to answer some question about the famous people in the world.
                    Then, the most interesting part is that you would have a chance to answer 10 questions.
                    For each question, there would be a pair of images, one image you have seen in the first session.
                    The other image is very similar is the correct one. Your task is to pick the image you have seen.
                    All the best!
