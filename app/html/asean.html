                We're Passionate, Collaborative and always looking for individuals who share the same attributes.
                </p>
            <p>i
                We welcome all talent who are studying and/or working in fields of Business and
                Technology. In fact, we highly value those who have strong aspirations in developing
                the e-commerce infrastructure in Southeast Asia.

                We are seeking those who share our vision and ambitious dreams of building up
                the e-commerce ecosystem in Southeast Asia. By improving the infrastructure
                through what we aim to do here, we can establish ourselves in this relatively untapped market.

                You can be part of this process, join our team and together we can make it
                greater than the forecasted statistics. The state of e-commerce in Southeast
                Asian countries now is roughly about 10 years behind that of China, it's a long
                journey to get to the stage of US and China combined. However with a lot patience,
                hard work and a relentless willpower to never give up, anything can be achieved.
